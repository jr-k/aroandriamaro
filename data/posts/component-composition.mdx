One simple way to improve your components in React is to use [composition](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html). This is a very simple pattern but yet not used that much by developers who just begun their React journey.

Basically, composition means using the `children` prop. With composition, you can improve **readability, modularity** and **flexibility**.

## List component

### The problem

Let's take a very simple example of a component that renders a list of items.

```tsx
// ‚ùå don't do this

// List.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';

interface ListProps {
  items: string[];
}

const List: FC<ListProps> = ({ items }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

// App.tsx
const App: FC = () => {
  return <List items={['John', 'Jane']} />;
};
```

The problem here is that it does not give much flexibility to the consumers (other developers) of our `List` component.

Sure, the component is very simple to use: you just have to pass an array of `string` to render items.

But what if you wanted to customize the individual item (say you want to add an icon to each item) ? You would have to update the `List` component yourself.

In a little codebase, this is not a problem in itself. But it can be a source of regression in a large codebase where `List` is used in many places.

And what if `List` was enclosed in a library or external package ? Then you don't have access to the internal of the component. Therefore, customization of individual item is not possible.

### The solution

To improve the flexibility of `List`, i-e give developers the power to customize the behavior of our component, we can re-write `List` with composition in mind.

```tsx
// ‚úÖ it is better

// List.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';

const List: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return <ul>{children}</ul>;
};

// App.tsx
const App: FC = () => {
  const items = ['John', 'Jane'];
  return (
    <List>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </List>
  );
};
```

As you can see, we give the responsibility of rendering the items to consumers of `List`. At first glance, it seems like giving more work to developers.

But, let's not stop there. We can build `ListItem` component to complete our example.

```tsx
// ‚úÖ it is even better

// List.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';

const List: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return <ul>{children}</ul>;
};

// ++++++++++
// ListItem.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';

const ListItem: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return <li>{children}</li>;
};
// ++++++++++

// App.tsx
const App: FC = () => {
  const items = ['John', 'Jane'];
  return (
    <List>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <ListItem key={item}>{item}</ListItem>
      ))}
    </List>
  );
};
```

This way, we give developers the power to render anything they want. In the first example, we were limited to rendering `string` only.

Composition gives developers the control of what should be rendered as individual items

Now, we can add icons to our individual item.

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { FC } from 'react';

const App: FC = () => {
  return (
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        <span>üöÄ</span>
        <p>Rocket</p>
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        <span>‚ú®</span>
        <p>Sparks</p>
      </ListItem>
    </List>
  );
};
```

## Other practical examples

### Button

```tsx
// ‚ùå don't do this
interface ButtonProps {
  text: string;
}
const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ text }) => {
  return <button>{text}</button>;
};

const App: FC = () => {
  return <Button text='Click me' />;
};
```

```tsx
// ‚úÖ do this instead
const Button: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
};

const App: FC = () => {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
};
```

### Navbar

```tsx
// ‚ùå don't do this
interface Link {
  href: string;
  text: string;
}
interface NavbarProps {
  links: Link[];
}
const Navbar: FC<NavbarProps> = ({ links }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      {links.map((link) => (
        <a key={link.text} href={link.href}>
          {link.text}
        </a>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
};

const LINKS = [
  { href: '/home', text: 'Home' },
  { href: '/signin', text: 'Sign In' },
];

const App: FC = () => {
  return <Navbar links={LINKS} />;
};
```

```tsx
// ‚úÖ do this instead
interface LinkProps {
  href: string;
}

const Navbar: FC = ({ children }) => {
  return <nav>{children}</nav>;
};
const Link: FC<LinkProps> = ({ href, children }) => {
  return <a href={href}>{children}</a>;
};

const App: FC = () => {
  return (
    <Navbar>
      <Link href='/home'>Home</Link>
      <Link href='/signin'>Sign In</Link>
    </Navbar>
  );
};
```

## Recap

Composition helps us give back developers the control (see [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)). They can customize and extend our component's behavior.

With this simple pattern, we can increase the modularity of our code.

In React, composition minimises [prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) issue. It is a [powerful tool to consider before using context](https://epicreact.dev/one-react-mistake-thats-slowing-you-down/) to avoid passing down props deep in the tree.
